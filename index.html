        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
            I was born in 2005, and my journey into the world of technology began
            in 2020. From the moment I wrote my first lines of code, I was
            captivated by the endless possibilities that technology offers. Since
            then, I have been continuously expanding my skills and knowledge,
            evolving from a curious learner to an aspiring full-stack developer. I
            specialize in frontend development, crafting clean and responsive user
            interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also exploring the
            backend with Java to build robust and scalable applications. My tech
            toolkit also includes Python, which I’ve used to develop practical
            projects like a currency converter, a password suggester, and even a
            small chatbot that responds to specific inputs. Beyond coding, I have
            a keen eye for UI/UX design, creating intuitive and user-friendly
            prototypes using Figma, and I efficiently manage projects using Git
            for version control. I am passionate about learning, problem-solving,
            and turning ideas into real-world applications. With every project, I
            aim to enhance my skills, stay updated with industry trends, and take
            steps toward becoming a proficient full-stack developer. My goal is to
            create innovative solutions that make a difference and push the
            boundaries of what's possible in the digital world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am an enthusiastic frontend developer with a solid grasp of HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript, focused on building responsive, user-friendly,
            and visually appealing web applications. Currently, I am expanding my
            skill set by learning backend development with Java, aiming to become
            a full-stack developer. I have worked on several projects that have
            improved my ability to write clean, optimized code and implement
            modern web practices. My design process is enhanced by my proficiency
            in Figma, allowing me to create wireframes, prototypes, and UI/UX
            designs that deliver seamless user experiences. I also have a strong
            understanding of Git, ensuring smooth version control, collaboration,
            and code management throughout the development cycle. I am passionate
            about problem-solving, continuous learning, and staying up-to-date
            with emerging technologies. I enjoy taking on new challenges and am
            committed to improving both my frontend and backend skills to deliver
            scalable and efficient solutions.
